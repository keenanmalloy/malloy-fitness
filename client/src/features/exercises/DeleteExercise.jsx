 * This component should make a DELETE request to remove the exercise.

 * 1. User clicks button
 * 2. Button opens modal with details about deleting the exercise and a confirmation button to send the request
 * 3. Clicking the confirmation button deletes the exercise.
 *
 * We already have this logic elsewhere, but we should centralize it in this component.
